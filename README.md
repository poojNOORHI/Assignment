This project is created in React Js.
I have created a few pages and components in individual folders in src folder.
I have created separate components and used them in the pages where ever i needed them.
I have taken a real time api data from a website where i have copied the object of json data.
I have copied the json data into "data.json" file and exported it.
I have mapped the json data in jobs component. 
When we click on the image, i have redirected to new page where we see the job details.
I have used react router dom for routing in the application.
I have used Link to redirect the pages. 
I have made the application responsive using media querries in html and css.
